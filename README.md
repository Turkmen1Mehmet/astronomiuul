# ✨ Introduction
The goal of "AstronoMiuul" is to analyze various characteristics of asteroids using NASA's dataset. Our team of four is exploring these datasets using scientific methods and data analysis techniques.

# 🖋️ Problem Statement
Our objectives include:

Estimating the diameters of asteroids,
Assessing the mining potential of these celestial bodies,
Analyzing the likelihood and consequences of potential asteroid impacts,
Calculating the dimensions of craters that might result from such impacts.
⚙️ Tools and Technologies
We use Python as our primary programming language and leverage libraries such as Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and PyAstronomy.

# 🪐 Asteroid Mining Potential
In this section, we evaluate asteroids over one kilometer in diameter for their mining viability. We analyze the size and surface features of these asteroids to determine which ones may contain higher quantities of valuable metals or water.

# 💥 Asteroid Impact Scenarios
While smaller asteroids generally pose no threat, larger ones could be a global hazard. We study the diameter and Earth-proximity of these asteroids, filtering known diameters to visualize potential impact scenarios.

# ⚡️ Potential Crater
We create scenarios with different variables to estimate the size of craters that could result from asteroid impacts. The analysis includes the energy released on impact and the resultant crater dimensions.

# 🧐 Diameter Estimation
We employ various machine learning models to estimate asteroid diameters. The LightGBM model has proven to be the most efficient and accurate in our analyses.

# 🌞 Solar System Dynamics
This section visualizes the three-dimensional distribution of asteroids within our solar system. We examine their positions and orbital dynamics along the X, Y, and Z axes.

# 📊 RFM-CLTV Analysis
This analysis uses variables such as the frequency of observations, the time of last observation, and the amount of data collected from observations. It systematically evaluates the scientific value of the asteroids.
